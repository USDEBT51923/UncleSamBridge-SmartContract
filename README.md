 ### Install & Run tests
```shell
yarn install
npx hardhat test 
```

* The code in the `/contracts` folder demonstrates LayerZero behaviours.
* `NonblockingLzApp` is a great contract to extend. Take a look at how `OmniCounter` overrides `_nonblockingLzReceive` and `_LzReceive` to easily handle messaging. There are also example for `OFT` and `ONFT` which illustrate erc20 and erc721 cross chain functionality.
* Always audit your own code and test extensively on `testnet` before going to mainnet 🙏

> The examples below use two chains, however you could substitute any LayerZero supported chain! 

## Most recently tested with node version `16.13.1`
